[Verse 1]

D         Em

I know you wanted me to stay

      Bm                            G

But I can't ignore the crazy visions of me in LA

D           Em

I heard that there's a special place

      Bm                              G

Where boys and girls can all be queens every single day

 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

D

  I'm having wicked dreams

Em

   Of leaving Tennessee

Bm

   Hear Santa Monica

G

 I swear it's calling me

D

  Won't make my mama proud

Em

   It's gonna cause a scene

Bm

   She sees her baby girl

G

 I know she's gonna scream

 

 

[Chorus]

D                      Em

God, what have you done?

                       Bm

You're a pink pony girl

                         G

And you dance at the club

            D               Em

Oh mama, I'm  just having fun

                        Bm

On the stage in my heels

                   G

It's where I belong down at the

D

Pink Pony Club

   Em

I'm   gonna keep on dancing at the

[Verse 2]

D         Em

I'm up and jaws are on the floor

Bm                          G

Lovers in the bathroom and a line outside the door

D                 Em

Black lights and a mirrored disco ball

Bm                          G

Every night's another reason why I left it all

 

 

[Pre-Chorus]

D

  I thank my wicked dreams

Em

   A year from Tennessee

Bm

   Oh, Santa Monica

G

 You've been too good to me

D

  Won't make my mama proud

Em

   It's gonna cause a scene

Bm

   She sees her baby girl

G

 I know she's gonna scream

 

 

[Chorus]

D                      Em

You're always on my mind

    G     A

And mama, every Saturday

Bm                               Em

I  can hear your southern drawl a thousand miles away, saying
